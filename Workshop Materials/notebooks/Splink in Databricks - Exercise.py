# MAGIC ## Evaluating Splink
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Whilst Splink does offer a supervised predictive method, our data does not have ground truth (we don't categorically know which records are duplicates or otherwise), so we're resigned to taking an unsupervised approach.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Unsupervised models are trickier to evaluate, because we can't compare the predictions against a known truth. How would we know how well our model has performed then? How can we evaluate the impact of changing parameters against the previous experiment?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We are proposing a loss function that promotes match probabilities within the pairwise prediction dataframe to be close to either 1 or 0 (i.e. the model is "certain" that a pair is a match or not). For a full explanation with examples of this proposed evaluation metric, please see the notebook _Splink Evaluation - explanation_ in the same directory as this one, but for the purpose of this exercise, all we need to know is that we want to __decrease the loss__ with our predictions.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can use the `get_match_probabilty_loss` method on the prediction dataframe generated by different models to compare them. The lower the loss, the better the model.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ***
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ##### A word of caution
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Please be aware that this is not a hard-and-fast, empirical way of evaluating a Splink model. Unsupervised entity resolution is complex and choosing the right model will depend on the data, use case, domain, expert knowledge, risk appetite, and many more factors.

# MAGIC ## Building a baseline model
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Lastly, we'll build a baseline model (using essentially the set-up of the previous demonstration), and log it as the first run in an MLFlow experiment.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We'll set an experiment based on the user ID generated at the start. You can navigate to it via

# MAGIC

# MAGIC ### Runnig a trial
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's do an initial run with the above parameters. Notice that this time we're making predictions inside the run as well to also log our loss and the plot generated inside the run.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The run should appear in your experiment (you may need to refresh if you have the tab open), or you can navigate to it via the hyperlink provided after the cell has started running.

# COMMAND ----------

# Start MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
  # Retrieve run ID
  RUN_ID = run.info.run_id

  # Train linker model
  linker = SparkLinker(data, spark=spark)

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Splink gives us the likelihood that a pair of records are the same, and also the clusters that are created by following the chain of pairs. If A&B are the same, and B&C are the same, then A&B&C are the same. This is a cluster.

# COMMAND ----------

# pairwise predictions
predictions.as_pandas_dataframe(limit=10)

# COMMAND ----------

# Creating the clusters requires setting a confidence threshold to indicate the degree of similarity between pairs. 
# If A&B have a 90% chance of the being the sae, and B&C a 10% chance, we don't want to connect A&B&C.

clusters = linker.cluster_pairwise_predictions_at_threshold(predictions, threshold_match_probability=0.5)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Using the trained model
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In the above MLflow run, we created and trained a `model` object. We can use this object directly for further predictions, or to make use of Splink's many built-in exploratory tools.

# COMMAND ----------

linker.m_u_parameters_chart()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC You can also call the `get_match_probabilty_loss` method directly on the predictions (as long as it's a Pandas dataframe) at any point to check your predictions.

# COMMAND ----------

baseline_loss, baseline_fig = get_match_probabilty_loss(predictions.as_pandas_dataframe())

# COMMAND ----------

linker.cluster_studio_dashboard(predictions, clusters, path, sampling_method="by_cluster_size", overwrite=True)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC To visualise clusters together, you can use the `visualise_linked_records` for a static (but less readable) picture of the connected records.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Use the `linkage_threshold` argument to set the minimum match probability, and the `min_linked_records` argument to set a minimum number of records in a cluster for it to be visualised. Avoid setting these too low or the visualisation will be unreadable.

# COMMAND ----------

visualise_linked_records(predictions.as_pandas_dataframe(), min_linked_records=10, linkage_threshold=0.9)

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Your Turn
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You now have a baseline model which no doubt could use some improvement, which will be up to you to make.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Suggestions for work:
# MAGIC 1. Explore the data with Spark/Pandas to better understand the contents of the columns - use Splink's built in profilers to help you.
# MAGIC 2. Use your intuition, your understanding of the data and how the distance functions work to devise a new set or sets of parameters that make more sense given the task.
# MAGIC 3. Train new models and use Splink's built-in visualisers to explore how your predictions were made.
# MAGIC 4. Calculate the loss and compare it against the baseline or previous runs.
# MAGIC 5. Submit new runs to your experiment. Track how the loss evolves with your different trials on the experiments page.
# MAGIC 6. Try and de-duplicate your data based on the clusters that you find.
# MAGIC 6. **If you need any help at all, reach out to a TA!**
# MAGIC 7. Prepare 1 slide for show and tell at the end of the hack.
